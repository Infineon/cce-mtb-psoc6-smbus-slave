*Disclaimer: This is a community code example (CCE) released for the benefit of the community users. These projects have only been tested for the listed BSPs, tools versions, and toolchains documented in this readme. They are intended to demonstrate how a solution / concept / use-case can be achieved on a particular device. For official code examples, please click [here](https://github.com/Infineon/Code-Examples-for-ModusToolbox-Software).*

This example demonstrates how to implement the SMBus slave on top of an SCB I2C and Timer in PSoC 6.

## Requirements

- [ModusToolbox&trade; software](https://www.infineon.com/modustoolbox-software) v3.1

  **Note:** This code example version requires ModusToolbox&trade; software version 3.1 and may not be compatible with other versions.

- Board support package (BSP) minimum required version: 4.0.0
- Programming language: C
- Associated parts: All [PSoC&trade; 6 MCU](https://www.infineon.com/PSoC6) parts

## Supported toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- GNU Arm&reg; embedded compiler v10.3.1 (`GCC_ARM`) - Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`

## Supported kits (make variable 'TARGET')

- [PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; pioneer kit](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/cy8ckit-062-wifi-bt/) (`CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT`) - Default value of `TARGET`

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** The [PSoC&trade; 6 Bluetooth&reg; LE pioneer kit](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/cy8ckit-062-ble/) (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the [PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; pioneer kit](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/cy8ckit-062-wifi-bt/) (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".


## Software setup

This example requires an I2C or SMBus master. You can use the Bridge Control Panel that comes with PSoC Programmer. Download [here](https://softwaretools.infineon.com/tools/com.ifx.tb.tool.psocprogrammer).

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br />

The following example clones the "[PSoC&trade; 6 MCU: Interrupt TCPWM](https://github.com/Infineon/cce-mtb-psoc6-tcpwm-interrupt)" application with the desired name "MyTCPWMInterrupt" configured for the *CY8CKIT-062-BLE* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-062-BLE --app-id mtb-example-psoc6-tcpwm-interrupt --user-app-name MyTCPWMInterrupt --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal using `make library-manager` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool "library-manager-cli" to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required
`--add-bsp-version`| Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from manifest | Optional
`--add-bsp-location`| Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP in a shared path | Optional

<br />

Following example adds the CY8CKIT-062-BLE BSP to the already created application and makes it the active BSP for the app:

   ```
   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MyTCPWMInterrupt" --add-bsp-name CY8CKIT-062-BLE --add-bsp-version "latest-v3.X" --add-bsp-location "local"

   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MyTCPWMInterrupt" --set-active-bsp APP_CY8CKIT-062-BLE
   ```

; Write Word (cmd + w word)
w 08 02 DE AD p
; Read word (cmd + r word)
w 08 02 r 08 x x p
; Process Call (invert bytes)
w 08 03 AA AA r 08 x x p
; Block write (num bytes + data)
w 08 04 08 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 p
; Block read (num bytes + data)
w 08 04 r 08 x x x x x x x x x p
; Block Process call (sum by one on every byte)
w 08 05 04 fe fe 00 00 r 08 x x x x x p
```

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

## Design and implementation

The SMBus slave interface is built on top of the SCB I2C block and uses a TCPWM timer to implement a timeout mechanism. The user is responsible to setup the I2C and Timer interrupts and call a respective function from the SMBus slave interface. In the device-configurator, the timer shall be connected to the I2C SCL line to trigger an interrupt when the same is low for more than 35 ms. This is done by connecting the I2C SCL signal to the following TCPWM inputs:
- Reload: On falling edge, the counter reloads to ZERO.
- Start: On falling edge, the counter starts. If the counter runs long enough, a terminal count interrupt occurs.
- Stop: On rising edge, the counter stops. In normal conditions, these happens less than the 35 ms timeout threshold.

The user can register a SMBus callback to capture any write or read commands. The SMBus commands are defined in the application and linked to the SMBus APIs. The following are the sequence of calls by the application:

1. Call `SMBus_Slave_Init()`. Note that the I2C block and address is required as argument and the I2C initialization is performed internally.
2. Call `SMBus_Slave_AddCommands()`. The commands shall be grouped in a list of structures, where each element follows this format:

   | Structure Name | Description | Example / Options |
   | :------------- | :---------- | :---------------- |
   | `.name` | Command name | "MyCommand" |
   | `.code` | Command code| 0 to 255 |
   | `.type` | Command type | `SMBUS_CMD_TYPE_SEND_BYTE` <br> `SMBUS_CMD_TYPE_RW_BYTE` <br> `SMBUS_CMD_TYPE_RW_WORD` <br> `SMBUS_CMD_TYPE_RW_BLOCK` <br> `SMBUS_CMD_TYPE_PROCESS_CALL` <br> `SMBUS_CMD_TYPE_BLOCK_PROCESS_CALL` |
   | `.size` | Command size | 0 to 255 |

3. Call `SMBus_Slave_RegisterCallback()` to register the function to be executed on every write and read command. The function shall have this format:

   `bool SMBus_Callback(void *arg, const smbus_cmd_t *cmd, bool is_read, uint8_t *value)`

   The `value` argument shall be accessed differenetly depending on the `is_read` argument. On read commands, the `value` argument shall be set to the desire response. On write commands, the `value` shall be transfered to the desire variables.

4. Initialize the interrupt handlers for the I2C and Timer blocks. In the I2C interrupt handler, call `SMBus_Slave_InterruptHandler()`. In the Timer interrupt handler, call `SMBus_Slave_Timeout()`.
